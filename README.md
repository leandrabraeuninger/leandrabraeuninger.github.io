    <p>
Leandra Bräuninger is an incoming doctoral student researching "Machine Learning for Mitigating Discrimination in Medicine and Healthcare" at the University College London supervised by [Dr Brieuc Lehmann](https://brieuclehmann.github.io/) and [Prof. Ioanna Manolopoulou](https://ioannamanolopoulou.github.io/).

Previously, Leandra held research and/or teaching positions in the areas of statistical fairness in genomics, mathematical malaria prediction, and basic biology at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) (London, UK), the [Mathematical Biology Group at the University of Melbourne](https://mathematical-biology.science.unimelb.edu.au/) (Australia), and the [Centre for Active Learning](https://cal.biol.ethz.ch/) in the Department of Biology at ETH Zurich (Switzerland).

Leandra's academic degrees in Mathematical Modelling of Global Health (MSc University of Oxford), Data Science and International Relations (BA University of St. Gallen), and work experience in HealthTech startups ([Haplo Care](https://www.haplocare.com/), [MiData](https://www.midata.coop/en/home/)) have led to a keen interest in the intersection of health - equity - technology. More specifically, in AI methods that improve medicine and healthcare for the whole of society (and not just a privileged few). To this end, the focus of the PhD is on the development of new, equitable AI systems with extensive interdisciplinary contextualisation.
