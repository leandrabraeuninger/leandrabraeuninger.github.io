## Bio
---
Leandra Bräuninger (they/them; she/her) is a doctoral student researching "Machine Learning for Mitigating Discrimination in Medicine and Healthcare" at the University College London supervised by [Dr Brieuc Lehmann](https://brieuclehmann.github.io/) and [Prof. Ioanna Manolopoulou](https://ioannamanolopoulou.github.io/). Research interests include interdisciplinary approaches to algorithmic fairness, actionable equity, conformal prediction, counterfactual frameworks and causal inference to name a few.

Previously, Leandra held research and/or teaching positions in the areas of statistical fairness in genomics, mathematical malaria prediction, and fundamental biology at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) (London, UK), the [Mathematical Biology Group at the University of Melbourne](https://mathematical-biology.science.unimelb.edu.au/) (Australia), and the [Centre for Active Learning](https://cal.biol.ethz.ch/) in the Department of Biology at ETH Zurich (Switzerland).

Leandra's academic degrees in Mathematical Modelling of Global Health (MSc University of Oxford), Data Science and International Relations (BA University of St. Gallen), and work experience in HealthTech startups ([Haplo Care](https://www.haplocare.com/), [MiData](https://www.midata.coop/en/home/)) have led to a keen interest in the intersection of health - equity - technology. More specifically, in AI methods which improve medicine and healthcare for the whole of society (and not just a privileged few). To this end, the focus of the PhD is on the development of new, equitable AI systems with extensive interdisciplinary contextualisation.

## Outreach
---
### DSxHE (Co-Organiser, Theme Co-Lead)
[Data Science for Health Equity (“DSxHE”)](https://www.datascienceforhealthequity.com/) is a global community that brings together experts and enthusiasts working at the intersection of data science and health inequities to ensure that the latest research and innovations improve health equity. Leandra is a co-organiser of the community working to define its Strategy & Impact as well as a co-lead of the Statistical Methods for Health Equity Theme.


### PhD seminar @ UCL Stats 2023-24 (Co-Organiser)
Monthly seminar series where PhD students of our Department showcase their work.
